# Deep Learning Notebooks

Basic Deep Learning from some lab tutorials that covers CNN, DNN, RNN and other techniques within them.

## Note(s):
* You may change the notebook path to use local for the datasets as the tutorials are run using Google Colab with Google Drive.

Python Notebooks that uses multiple libraries from the following:
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* Pandas
* sklearn
* matplotlib (for visualizations)

## Prerequisites
* Python 3 (pip)
* Jupyter Server

## Issues
* Can't run Tensorflow on Apple M series processors.
